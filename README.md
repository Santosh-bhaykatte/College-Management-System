# College Management System
A robust, console-based College Management System built in Java. This project demonstrates key programming concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), modular design, file handling, searching, and sorting algorithms. It allows efficient management of student and faculty records while ensuring data integrity through validation mechanisms like ID duplication checks.

This project started as a basic CRUD application but evolved into a scalable college administration system that can be easily customized for different institutions.
